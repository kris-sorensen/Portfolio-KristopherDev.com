About:
    Brainstorm:
        ✔ Move about page into its own page and restore home page @done(22-09-13 10:59)
        ☐ add depth to game(maybe have a back plane canvas with btns coming out)
        ✔ setup Canvas @done(22-09-13 10:59)
        ✔ cleanup files @done(22-09-13 11:00)
        ☐ onHover for btn and onClick
        ☐ write rules: under game in fadded cloud duster font or similar 
        ☐ program game
            ☐ onHover (only when not doing sequence) square hightlights its color
            ☐ default color of low opacity gray
            ☐ each square with have a shader behind it that is scalled slightly bigger and will act like outer atmosphere on earth
            ☐ 2-3x flashes of green when get sequence correct
                ☐ triggers next sequence
            ☐ 2-3x flashes of red when incorrect sequence and starting over
                ☐ triggers restart
                ☐ will also trigger red flashes and restart if too much time inbetween clicks
            ☐ An array to hold the current sequence
            ☐ Restart
                ☐ clear array
                ☐ assign random color to each square. 
            ☐ Sequence
                ☐ starts with one. after sequence and after every correct hit will restart timer giving player x amount of time to hit the next point
                ☐ sequence will play on an interval timer that will have a sequence index state that will update with every sequence. will use interval to slow down how often a sequence is shown. maybe every 1/2 second.
            ☐ light show when x(20?) in a row is achieved
            ☐ when sequence is correct all colors flash 2-3x
            ☐ Setup
                ☐ each square gets assigned a random color onLoad and restart
            ☐ onClick
                ☐ will check to see if appropriate block was chosen and move index state 1. each time will check to see if you have reached the end of the sequence or trigger a restart if an incorrect block was choosen.
                ☐ onClick and color stays on for a second before fading out
                ☐ will have a playing sequence boolean state that will only allow firing of onClicks if false. same with hovers

    Actionable Steps:
        
        Variabls:

                ✔ refs to access sqares @done(22-09-13 17:09)
                ✔ array of refs @done(22-09-13 17:09)
                ✔ state: array of colors (9) @done(22-09-13 17:09)

                // playing sequrence
                ✔ State: sequence array. default empty @done(22-09-13 19:51)
                ✔ State: playingSequence(false) @done(22-09-14 11:31)
               

                //clicking

                ✔ state: simonIndex(0) @done(22-09-13 19:51)

                //timer

                ☐ have a 5second timer that counts down. will show visually on screen. starts over when a click is made.

                //level

                ☐ have a round marker that gets updated on finishing sequence and reset if hit fail
            
                

            Functions:

                    ✔ have a loop to assign each sqaure that color using ref. Change color and add a uColor variable to all squares with saved color @done(22-09-13 19:51)

                    ☐ choose final colors

                    ☐ trigger restart





                ✔ Restart and onload useEffect hook that starts everything @done(22-09-13 22:21)
                Other:
                    ☐ mobile friendly
                    ☐ add fade quick fade effect for onClick
